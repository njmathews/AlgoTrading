Strategy Components
-------------------

### Indicators Used

1.  **Exponential Moving Averages (EMA)**
    
    *   Short EMA (9-period): Captures short-term market trends.
        
    *   Long EMA (21-period): Indicates long-term market direction.
        
    *   A bullish trend is identified when the short EMA crosses above the long EMA.
        
2.  **MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence)**
    
    *   Measures the momentum of price movements.
        
    *   Positive histogram suggests bullish momentum, negative histogram signals bearish conditions.
        
3.  **RSI (Relative Strength Index)**
    
    *   Provides insights into overbought and oversold conditions.
        
    *   RSI above 50 supports a bullish trend; below 50 hints at bearishness.
        
4.  **SuperTrend**
    
    *   Tracks market direction and provides dynamic support/resistance levels.
        
    *   Signals bullish trends when above the closing price and bearish trends when below.
        
5.  **ATR (Average True Range)**
    
    *   Used to set dynamic stop-loss levels based on market volatility.
        
    *   Helps avoid premature exits in volatile markets.
        

### Entry Conditions

A long position is initiated when:

1.  Short EMA crosses above the long EMA.
    
2.  MACD histogram is positive.
    
3.  RSI is above 50.
    
4.  SuperTrend is above the closing price.
    
5.  A dynamic ATR-based stop loss is set immediately.
    

### Stop Loss & Exit Strategy

*   Stop loss is initially set based on a multiple of ATR.
    
*   Stop loss is adjusted to breakeven once the trade becomes profitable.
    
*   Exit signals include:
    
    *   Price crossing below the SuperTrend.
        
    *   RSI exceeding 70 (overbought conditions).
        
    *   MACD histogram turning negative.
